        <H3 style= "color:red;text-decoration:underline; text-decoration-color:red;"> What is a pet? </H3>
        <p style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:18px;" > A pet, or companion animal, is an animal kept primarily for a <strong>person's company or entertainment</strong> rather than as a working animal, livestock or a laboratory animal. </p>
    <h3 style="color:red;text-decoration:underline; text-decoration-color:red;";>  SO WHY DO WE HAVE PETS?</h3>
    <img src = "rrfr.jpg" style = "float:right";>
        <p style="font-size:18px;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong> Pets can enhance your mood </strong>
            <br>
            Whether you believe it or not, pets are a great way to improve your mood and temperament. Research has shown that people who suffer from various diseases have lesser chances of depression if they keep pets as compared to those who are suffering from similar diseases and don't keep pets.
            <br>
            <strong>Help to control blood pressure </strong>
            <br>
            Health experts say that dog owners have less blood pressure and heart rates. This eventually reduces the need to take medicines and also helps reduce cholesterol and triglyceride levels.
            <br>
            <strong> A source of exercise </strong>
           <br>

            Want someone who will accompany you for walks? Dogs can be great companions and will happily go out for walks, at times even urging you for a walk, when you're too tired, thereby keeping you active and fit. Other activities related to pets like feeding, bathing, playing and cleaning are also good ways to exercise.
            <br>
            <strong>An antidote for loneliness </strong>
            <br>
            No matter how low or lonely you keep, a pet will always be there for you. Whether you want to pour your heart out to them or tell them your secrets, you know it's all safe with them! Pets give you unconditional love and are always faithful.
            <br>
            <strong>Reduce stress </strong>
            <br>
            Stressed out? Pets are known to reduce stress and anxiety levels. Experts say that people can get relieve from stress and depression, if they spend time with their pets.
            <br>
            <strong>Long life </strong>
            <br>
            Several studies have revealed that people who tend to spend their time with pets are more likely to live longer than people who don't.
            <br>
            <strong>Better social skills </strong>
        <br>
            Want to improve your social skills? It is said that people who keep pets are said to be good in their social relations. Kids who grow up with pets at home are always respectful towards living things.
            <br>
            <strong>Safety</strong>
        <br>
            Having a dog at home is especially good because they also double up as caretakers. No burglar alarm can be better than a dog at home</p>

        <h3 STYLE="color:red;text-decoration:underline; text-decoration-color:red;"> PHYSICAL EFFECTS ON HUMANS </h3>
        <p style="font-size:18px;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Physical exercise causes the human body to release <strong>endorphins</strong> - chemicals that make us feel happy. Research has also found a possible link between a lack of vitamin D obtained through sun exposure and depression.
          By walking our dogs or just spending time with them outside on a sunny day we are likely to become more content.
          <br>
          Studies have shown that even small interactions with dogs cause the human brain to produce oxytocin, a hormone often referred to as the “cuddle chemical.” <strong>Oxytocin</strong> increases feelings of relaxation, trust, and empathy while reducing stress and anxiety.</p>
          <p style="font-size:18px;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Every little bit counts when it comes to physical health benefits, and those daily walks really add up for dog owners. Since they are more likely to meet the criteria for regular moderate exercise, dog parents have lower instances of obesity. 

            Your heart is one of the biggest spots to see the full benefits of pet ownership. Just the presence of animals has significant impacts on blood pressure, with pet owners having a lower resting blood pressure than people without pet babies. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Cat parents aren't left out of the healthy heart race. A feline friend in your home <strong>reduces your risk of death due to cardiovascular diseases, including stroke and heart attacks</strong>. According to the <strong>Human Animal Bond Research Institute (HABRI)</strong>, people without cats have a 40% higher relative risk of heart attack than non-cat owners.
            <br>
            Approximately <strong>60% of dog walkers</strong> met the criteria for regular moderate and/or vigorous leisure-time physical activity compared with about 45% for non-dog owners and dog owners who did not walk their dog in a <strong>2005 Michigan Behavioral Risk Factor Survey</strong>.
<br>
            In a study of adults over the age of 50 with mildly elevated blood pressure, the presence of a pet dog or cat had a significant impact on blood pressure, with dog ownership being associated with lower diastolic and systolic blood pressure compared to people who did not own pets.
A study of over 2,400 cat owners concluded there was a significantly lower relative risk for death due to <strong>cardiovascular diseases, including stroke and heart attack</strong>, compared to non-owners during a 20-year follow-up.
