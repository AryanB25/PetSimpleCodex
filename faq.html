                      planning?</h4>
          
                      <p>• Microchip your pets and keep ID tags on collar updated (especially if
          
                          you move).<br>
          
                          • Make a kit for your pet with supplies and important documents.<br>
          
                          • Share pet information and evacuation plans with family and neighbors.<br>
          
                          • Keep a list of places that can shelter animals in an emergency.<br>
          
                          • Plan transportation in advance.<br>
          
                          • Be aware of your pets favorite hiding places in case they get scared <br>
          
                          and hide during an emergency. <br>
          
                          • Practice your evacuation drill every 6 months. <br>

                      3. What is the difference between planning an evacuation with
          
                      your pet and sheltering in place?</h4>
          
           
          
                      <p>
          
                          During an emergency, police or other authorities may ask you to evacuate
          
                          your home if it is too dangerous to stay. <br>
          
                          Having a plan ready will help you leave as soon as possible.<br>
          
                          In some emergencies, the safest plan is to staywhere you are with your pet.<br>
          
                          These emergencies are: chemical spill, extreme weather or a threat of violence. <br>
          
                          When you shelter in place with your pets, keep them inside and find the safest place in your home, away from windows. <br>
          
                          Be sure to keep your pets inside or in a crate until you know it is safe.<br>
          
                          </p>
          
          <h4 id="jdjd"> 4. In an emergency, what should I do first? </h4>
          <p>
            1. Keep calm and assess the scene for any additional threats to you or your pet. This is important for everyone's safety.
            <br>
            2. Keep your dog warm (except in the case of heat stroke), as quiet as possible, and keep movement to a minimum, especially if there is possible trauma, broken limbs, or any neurological symptoms.
            <br>
            3. Contact your veterinary hospital, inform them of the situation and get specific first aid advice.
            <br>
            4. To safely move or transport an injured dog, get somebody to help you. For a small dog, put him into his carrier (remove the top for easy and safe access to the carrier; DO NOT push an injured dog through the small door or opening), or use a suitable container such as a strong cardboard box. For a larger dog, use a makeshift stretcher made out of some rigid material such as an appropriate sized, sturdy piece of wood. Carefully maneuver your dog onto a blanket or coat so that he can be gently moved to the carrier, box, or stretcher.
            <br>
            5. Get to a veterinary hospital as soon as possible.
