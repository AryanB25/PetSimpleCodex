           <h3>Sphynx Cat</h3>

           <p>Sphynx ‚ùù/Ààsf…™≈ãks/ Sfyngks‚ùû ìÉ† ‚Ä¢ is a breed of cat known for its lack of fur. Hairlessness in cats is a naturally occurring genetic mutation, and the Sphynx was developed through selective breeding of these animals, starting in the 1960s.</p>

           <br>

           <h3>Ragdoll</h3>

           <h3>Scottish Fold</h3>

           <br>

           <h3>Savannah Cat</h3>

           <br><hr>
           <h2 id = "fish" style="color:red;"><u>Fish</u></h2>
           <h3> Betta </h3>
           <p> Betta
            For ease of maintenance, bettas can't be beat. Also known as Siamese fighting fish, bettas require separation from most other species, which means these brilliantly colored swimmers do well in small fish bowls. While keeping male bettas separate is imperative, some female bettas can live in tanks with other fish. Bettas are a cold-water species.</p>
            <h3> Goldfish </h3>
            <p> Another cold-water fish, goldfish belong to the carp family. Because they enjoy cool water temperatures, keep goldfish in a separate tank from warm water fish. Avoid keeping goldfish in a bowl, as they can grow quite long and need sufficient swimming room. Because they do grow so large, don't overcrowd your goldfish tank. Well-kept goldfish can live for many years.
             </p>
             <img src = "getty.jpg" style="float:right" width="600" height="600";>
             <h3> Angelfish </h3>
             <p>Large, lovely and graceful, angelfish appear in various color patterns. Because of their size when full-grown, angelfish require at least a 55-gallon tank. Angelfish do well with other fish species (although they may eat very small fish) but can fight with each other. Provide plenty of plants in the aquarium, as angelfish like to hide beneath them.
            </p>
            <h3> Catfish </h3>
            <p> Catfish aren't the most spectacular fish in a tank, but they serve an important purpose. These low-maintenance, bottom-dwelling fish consume algae growing in the tank, so they aid in keeping the tank clean. Choose among various catfish species and colors. Most types of catfish are compatible with the fish commonly kept in community tanks.</p>
           <h3> Guppies </h3>
           <p>These easy-care aquarium fish appear in a variety of colors. There is one drawback to guppies: They breed constantly, so if you have male and females together, the offspring can soon overwhelm a tank. For best results, choose all males or all females. The former sport longer tails and brighter colors.</p>
            <h3> Mollies </h3>
            <p>These small, hardy fish do best in tanks with heavy filtration. Unlike many tropical fish breeds, mollies bear live young rather than lay eggs. If you want to raise mollies, a ratio of one male per three to four females works best. Too many male mollies stress out the females with constant breeding. Mollies tend to nip the fins of other species, so you may want to keep them in a separate aquarium. Keeping a few mollies in a community tank can work out well.</p>
